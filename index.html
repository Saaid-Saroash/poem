<h1>Poem</h1>
<h2>~ by Saaid Saroash</h2>

<p>
I like the dark, the cold, the hush,
Where noise can’t chase and thoughts don’t rush.
A cup of coffee, bitter, black—
The world moves fast, I don’t look back.

Born into rules I didn't design,
Gilded cage, but it still feels mine.
The structure that once held me tight
Now slips away like fading light.
I liked the chains I once condemned,
Without their weight, I feel less hemmed.

Past is the best yet worst I've seen,
Restrictions gone but discipline's keen.
Strict parents shaped my every hour,
A life controlled with rigid power.
From birth, my path was drawn, aligned,
Each step prepared, each thought assigned.

Bestowing upon their wisdom every this and then,
Calling it the freedom even they can't stand.
Ambivalent life and parents' aesthetics,
Can't be sure if it's entirely pathetic.

Admit it even you're not angel, fallen from heaven,
Perhaps an incident that changed you in seven.

You dance through chaos with steady grace,
While I just stumble, lost in place.

I stood through storms no soul could endure,
Enigmatic resilience portrays me sure.
But now those rules are wearing thin,
And I don’t know where else to begin.
I miss the cage I used to fight,
It held me still—it felt so right.

Scars still bleed from the chains once tight,
Memories haunt in the dead of night.

I’ve known the world through shifting scenes,
From coast to coast, through broken dreams.
But never stayed to watch things grow,
Each place a face I used to know.
Four years at most—I disappear,
Another chapter, another year.

A hundred friends, but none too close,
Not by fault, just how life goes.
Each time I meet, I plan goodbye—
Connections made beneath a sky
That never stays, that always moves,
So roots become what time removes.

One friend alone, and I unfold,
With others near, I just grow cold.
Not fear, not shyness, just my way—
A quiet calm I won’t betray.

The past still whispers in my sleep,
Digging the wounds I swore were deep.

I’m shaped by fire, carved by time,
A fragile strength that learned to climb.

The moment hit and broke your pride,
And now that echo lives inside.

They see me as the perfect mold,
Attending galas, speaking bold.
A face for family, sharp and clean,
But few get past what’s ever seen.
They call me strong, they say I shine,
But don’t see cracks beneath the line.

I said it’s over, so did you,
But truth still hides in what we knew.
The life they built, the role I play
I walk it still, but lost my way.
